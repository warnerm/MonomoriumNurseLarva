This repository contains all relevant analysis for the following publication:
Warner, M.R., Mikheyev, A.S. & Linksvayer, T.A. 2019. Transcriptomic basis and evolution of the 
ant social interactome. In press, PLOS Genetics. Preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/514356

STEM_figures.R and final_analysis.R create all relevant figures and perform published statistical analyses. These files use results of other analyses (DEanalysis_nurse.R, STEMalg.R, Genie_Nov.R). These results are included in the results and/or data folders for convenience, but could be re-run if desired. Note that Genie and STEM are non-deterministic, so results stemming from these algorithms may vary slightly.
